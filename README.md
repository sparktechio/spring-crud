# Spring Boot CRUD Extension

This Spring Boot extension provides base CRUD services, controllers, and mappers to speed up the implementation of CRUD endpoints for your entities. By leveraging this extension, you can automatically generate endpoints for **Create**, **Read One**, **Update**, **Delete**, and **Search** operations with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Base CRUD Endpoints**: Automatically generated endpoints for standard CRUD operations:
  - Create (POST)
  - Read One (GET by ID)
  - Update (PUT)
  - Delete (DELETE by ID)
  - Search (GET with filtering)
- **Flexible DTO Mapping**: Mappers are provided to convert between:
  - Request DTO → Entity
  - Entity → Response DTO
- **Easy Integration**: Simply define your entity, DTOs, and mappers, and the extension takes care of the rest.

## How It Works

To get started with this extension, you just need to define a few classes for each of your entities:

1. **Entity**: Your JPA entity representing the database table.
2. **Request DTO**: A Data Transfer Object (DTO) for receiving API requests.
3. **Response DTO**: A DTO for returning data in API responses.
4. **Mapper**: A mapper interface or class that converts between your Entity and DTOs.

Once you have defined these, the extension will automatically generate the required endpoints and map data accordingly.

## Setup

### 1. Define Your Entity

Define a standard JPA entity with annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Id`, etc.

```java
@Getter
@Setter
@Entity
@Table(name = "organizations")
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@ToString(onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true, callSuper = true)
@EqualsAndHashCode(onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true, callSuper = true)
public class OrganizationEntity extends AutoIdBaseEntity<String> implements Organization {

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "about", length = 2000)
    private String about;

    @Embedded
    private Contact contact;
}
```

### 2. Define Request DTO

Create a DTO that will be used for incoming requests, typically for Create and Update operations.

```java
@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class OrganizationRequestDto implements Organization {

    @NotNull(message = "Organization name is required")
    private String name;
    @Size(max = 2000, message = "The max length of 'about' is 2000 chars")
    private String about;
    private Contact contact;
}
```

### 3. Define Response DTO

Create a DTO for outgoing responses.

```java
@Getter
@Setter
public class OrganizationResponseDto extends AuditDto implements IdHolder<String>, Organization {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String about;
    private Contact contact;
}
```

### 4. Create a Mapper

Define a mapper interface or class that handles mapping between the Entity and DTOs.

```java
@Mapper(componentModel = "spring", uses = {PlainUserMapper.class})
public interface OrganizationMapper extends CrudMapper<String, OrganizationRequestDto, OrganizationEntity, OrganizationResponseDto>, Organization {
}
```

### 5. Inherit from the Base Service and Controller

To use the provided functionality, extend the base CRUD service and controller:

```java
@Getter
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class OrganizationService implements CrudService<String, OrganizationEntity>, Organization {

    private final EntityManager entityManager;
}

@Getter
@RestController
@RequestMapping("admin/organizations")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Tags(value = {@Tag(name = "Admin | Organizations"), @Tag(name= "OrganizationWithAdmin")})
public class AdminOrganizationController implements
        SRUDController<String, OrganizationRequestDto, OrganizationEntity, OrganizationResponseDto>, Organization {

    private final OrganizationService service;
    private final OrganizationMapper mapper;
}
```

## Available Endpoints

The following endpoints are automatically available for each entity:

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                         |
|--------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/admin/organizations`           | Create a new entity                 |
| GET    | `/admin/organizations/{id}`      | Read a single entity by ID          |
| PUT    | `/admin/organizations/{id}`      | Update an existing entity by ID     |
| DELETE | `/admin/organizations/{id}`      | Delete an entity by ID              |
| GET    | `/admin/organizations`    | Search for entities with filters    |

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the following dependencies in your `pom.xml` (or `build.gradle` for Gradle users):

```xml
<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.sparktechcode</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-crud</artifactId>
			<version>${sparktech.version}</version>
		</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Customization

If you need to add custom logic for any CRUD operation, you can override methods in your service or controller classes.
